-   I think that the process to analyse data and make a report is the hardest thing, even though we are pretty much sure how we should write a proper report.
-   I think that find some certain functions by using help is the easy part even though, we did not cover a lot during the class.
-   The error I was struggling with is how to find and use the density function.
-   I do not really understand how to describe data
-   The most time consuming part is write a summary
-   I did not collaborate with other students
-   It was all right.
